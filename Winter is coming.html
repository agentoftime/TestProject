	<pre>
		Her voice is carried by long ago winds, across the sea of time.
		It warns us all of what is to come should we stay the current course we've designed.
		Few heed the words and try to desparately make us all intune. 
		The ones in lead, scoff and continue in their destructive ways, blocking out the "loons". 
		When diaster strikes the same ask why the event even transpired,
		Choosing to blame the few who listened, throwing them into the fire. 
		Too proud to admit that they were wrong, they fake that everything is running smooth,
		Instead of bettering the world, we have turned it uncouth.
		Driving ourselves deeper to the brink, in which there is no turning...
